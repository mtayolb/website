                        <p>
                            Fake news can either be news that is deliberately published to get people to believe something that is not true or news that has some truth to it but does not tell the whole story. The first type of fake news are deliberate lies that are put online, even though the person writing them knows that they are made up. The second type of fake news may happen because the people writing it don't check all of the facts before publishing the story and they might exaggerate some of it. Also, a story might be called fake news when it isn't by people, who don't want to accept that the news is true, this can be another form of fake news.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One main reason is that it can make people believe things that are completely untrue. In addition, it can make people have less trust in the media, as well as make everyone believe something that might be inaccurate. Finally, people also only tend to share things that they agree with. So if people are sharing a lot of fake news, and lots of people believe it, it's easy to get sucked into a bubble that is actually completely different to the real world and a long way from the truth. In addition, calling something fake news, when it isn't really, is a problem as it can mean some people don't know what to believe anymore.
