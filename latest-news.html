                        <p>Throughout the on going coronavirus pandemic there have been multiple reports of fake news surounding how it has been spread. One of these theories is 5G where people are saying that 5G technolgy suppresses the immune system or somehow transmits the virus. Scientists have said the both claims are completly untrue and impossible as the 5G waves are not strong enough to affect the immune system and it is biologically impossible for them to transmite the virus from on person to another.</p>

                        <p>In 2021 there has been big developments in making a vaccine in response to the coronavirus pandemic. However there have been misleading claims about the testing of the vaccine targeting ethnic minorities. These claims started from a video of two french doctors discussing the initial testing of a possible vaccine in afric first before being tried anywhere else. Even though this did not happen, the comments led to an angry uproar on social media as people believed they wanted to use africa as human guinea pigs to test the vaccine on.</p>
